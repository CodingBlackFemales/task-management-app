# Start Here

In the next sections, we'll look at the design (or specification) of each of the components needed for a given requirement.

Generally speaking, each functionality will be implemented via four types of components:

1. A **controller** 
    > It will be in charge of handling a `HTTP` request, and responding with an appropriate `HTTP` response.

2. A **query** or a **command**
    > Following the [Command and Query Responsibility Segregation][1] pattern. A command is used to change the state of the system, whereas a query is used to retrieve information about the system.

3. A **domain entity**
    > Which we'll use to model a task and its operations.

4. A **repository**
    > Which we'll use to store and retrieve tasks in the system. For simplicity, we'll use an in-memory repository.
